TODO list for Perl module Statistics::LineFit

Test and document what happens as the sum of the deviations of the x
values approaches zero.

Test and document the sensitivity of the results to random and Gaussian
noise.

Abstract this module into an inheritance hierarchy that could do
N-dimensional line fitting, curve fitting, cubic splines fitting,
non-linear regression, etc.
